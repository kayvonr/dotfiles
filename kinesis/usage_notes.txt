General process to use the smartset app:
* Enable power user mode: Program + Shift + Esc (4 blinks on, 2 blinks off)
* Mount the v-drive: Program + F1 (same re: blinks)
* Open smartset app
* Make changes or load the layout from this repo
* close the smartset app
* eject (via OS) the kinesis drive
    * Note: sometimes it mounts back automatically. if so, do the next step quickly after this one, before it mounts back
* close v-drive via keyboard: Program + F1
* disable power user mode: Program + Shift + Esc

If I've bricked the keyboard again (from the email from Kinesis Support 2020-11-30):
* Do a self-format command: Program + Shift + Ctrl + F
    * Note that by default ctrl is mapped to either the top-left or top-right button on right-side thumb cluster
* Enable power user mode: Program + Shift + Esc
* Mount the v-drive: Program + F1
* Rename the drive to "Kinesis KB"
* Run app as normal
